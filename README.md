Hi, I’m @SteveIsABot!<br>

---

<p> I like to make small little projects that can automate a daily task.
  I quite like learning small ease of life skills even if won't end up using them.
  I want to get better at C++, C# and Python.

My current favorite project that I have worked on was:
- Infinite Terrain Generation
- Team Project 2022 (Team Website Development)
