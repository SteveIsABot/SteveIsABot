Hi, I’m @SteveIsABot!<br>

---

<p> I like to make small little projects that can automate a daily task.
  I quite like learning small ease of life skills even if won't end up using them.
  I want to get better at C++, C# and Python.
  I would also like to start a new project that can automate the making of a TikTok Reddit story video.
  Currently, I am a student at Newcastle University in his final year of his Mcomp Degeree.

My current favorite project that I have worked on was:
- Infinite Terrain Generation
- Team Project 2023 (Team Website Development)

---
<p>My current hobbies are, gym, playing pool, and I am new boldering.
I actively try to partace in these hobbies as much as possible and quite enjoy them.
